          <h2>Local Storage VS Session Storage</h2>
          <h5>Title description, Dec 7, 2017</h5>
          <div class="fakeimg" style="min-height: 200px">
            <table style="width: 100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Local Storage</th>
                <th>Session Storage</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>
                  This read-only interface property provides access to the
                  Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored
                  across browser sessions. It is cleared when the last “private”
                  tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document
                  loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).
                </td>
                <td>
                  Session Storage objects can be accessed using the
                  sessionStorage read-only property. <br /><br />
                  The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that
                  localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data
                  is cleared when the page session ends.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>
                  If a document is loaded from a file: URL (that is, directly
                  from the user’s local file system instead of being loaded from
                  the server) the requirements for behavior are undefined and
                  may vary among different browsers. Each file appears to be
                  returned a different object by localStorage in all current
                  browsers: URL. Essentially, it seems to be a case of each URL:
                  file having its own unique local storage area.
                </td>
                <td>
                  A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded
                  in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at
                  a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the
                  tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the page
                  reloads and restores. Each tab/window that is opened with the
                  same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a
                  tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the
                  duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and
                  clears sessionStorage objects.
