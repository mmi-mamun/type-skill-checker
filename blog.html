              <tr>
                <th>Local Storage</th>
                <th>Session Storage</th>

              <tr>
                <td>
                  This read-only interface property provides access to the
                  Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored
                  across browser sessions. It is cleared when the last “private”
                  tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document
                  loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).
                </td>
                <td>
                  Session Storage objects can be accessed using the
                  sessionStorage read-only property. <br /><br />
                  The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that
                  localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data
                  is cleared when the page session ends.
                </td>

              <tr>
                <td>
                  If a document is loaded from a file: URL (that is, directly
                  from the user’s local file system instead of being loaded from
                  the server) the requirements for behavior are undefined and
                  may vary among different browsers. Each file appears to be
                  returned a different object by localStorage in all current
                  browsers: URL. Essentially, it seems to be a case of each URL:
                  file having its own unique local storage area.
                </td>
                <td>
                  A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded
                  in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at
                  a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the
                  tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the page
                  reloads and restores. Each tab/window that is opened with the
                  same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a
                  tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the
                  duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and
                  clears sessionStorage objects.

            How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?
          </h2>

          <p style="background-color: #875180; color: white; padding: 10px">
            The above diagram demonstrates the basic workflow between the Event
            Loop and the Task Queue. <br />
            <br />
            Before we discuss the event loop, lets first go through the function
            of the task queue. <br />

            Back to our timeout example, once the Web API finishes executing the
            task, it doesn’t just push it back to the Call Stack automatically.
            It goes to the Task Queue. <br /><br />

            A queue is a data structure that works on the First in First out
            principle, so as tasks get pushed into the queue, they get out in
            that same order. Tasks that have been executed by the Web API’s,
            which are being pushed to the Task Queue, then go back to the Call
            Stack to get their result printed out.

            <br /><br />
            <br />The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to
            be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call
            Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks
            the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes
            it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again,
            and repeats the same process. <br /><br />While this is a very basic
            introduction, the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript
            gives enough insight to clearly understand what is going on under
            the hood and how JavaScript is able to run concurrently and
            asynchronously with just a single thread.
